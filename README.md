# TrainControl

TrainControl is a signaling system for Traincraft that can be used in ComputerCraft or OpenComputers. It is designed to be functional and modular.

Note, you should not be using the code that is on here. It is very experimental, unfinished, and broken. However, if you still want to, then that's okay. Do your own things I guess.

## Installation

Download it from the Github for now, until I get it on OPPM.

## Usage

```lua
traincontrol <log/gui/nothing>
```

## Contributing
I like contributions! Contributions are welcome. Just make sure that they are in push requests and they don't suck.

Oh, and please, give me credit for the original code. I know, crazy, but just please do. Any violationers will get their cheeks clapped >:(
